3. Run commands:
   ```cmd
   # Debug build
   dotnet build -c Debug

   # Release build
   dotnet build -c Release
   ```

### Output Locations
- Debug: `bin/Debug/net6.0-windows/NotesTasks.exe`
- Release: `bin/Release/net6.0-windows/NotesTasks.exe`

## Usage Guide

### Basic Controls
1. **Toggle Key**
   - Click "Set Toggle Key" button
   - Press any key to set as toggle
   - Current toggle key shown in bold

2. **Strength Adjustment**
   - Use slider to set strength (1-20)
   - Changes apply immediately
   - Separate controls for recoil and jitter

3. **System Tray**
   - Optional minimize to tray
   - Double-click tray icon to restore
   - Right-click for context menu
   - Clean exit via tray menu

### Advanced Features

1. **Debug Panel**
   - Toggle with "Show Debug Info"
   - Real-time state monitoring
   - Performance metrics
   - Input state tracking

2. **Macro Activation**
   - Use toggle key for ON/OFF
   - Hold both LMB + RMB simultaneously for macro activation
   - You can toggle jiter mode
   - Window title shows current state

## Usage Scenarios

### Macro Activation Mechanics

1. **Basic Controls**
   - Toggle Key: Turns the entire macro system ON/OFF
   - Activation Trigger: Both LMB (Left Mouse Button) + RMB (Right Mouse Button) must be held simultaneously
   - Window Title: Shows current macro state (ON/OFF)

2. **Using Recoil Reducer**
   - First ensure macro is ON using toggle key
   - Hold both LMB + RMB simultaneously to activate
   - Recoil compensation starts immediately
   - Release either button to stop
   - Adjust strength (1-20) using the slider

3. **Using Jitter Mode**
   - Enable Jitter mode using the toggle
   - Ensure macro is ON using toggle key
   - Hold both LMB + RMB simultaneously to activate
   - Jitter pattern starts immediately
   - Release either button to stop
   - Adjust strength independently (1-20)

### Example Scenarios

1. **Recoil Only**
   ```
   1. Press Toggle Key â†’ Macro ON
   2. Hold LMB + RMB together â†’ Recoil compensation active
   3. Release either button â†’ Recoil compensation stops
   4. Adjust strength as needed
   ```

2. **Recoil with Jitter**
   ```
   1. Press Toggle Key â†’ Macro ON
   2. Enable Jitter mode
   3. Hold LMB + RMB together â†’ Both effects active
   4. Release either button â†’ All effects stop
   5. Adjust both strengths independently
   ```

3. **No Effects**
   ```
   - Macro OFF â†’ No effects regardless of buttons
   - Macro ON but single button â†’ No effects
   - Macro ON but buttons pressed separately â†’ No effects
   ```

### Important Notes
- Effects ONLY activate when BOTH buttons are held simultaneously
- Releasing either button immediately stops all effects
- Toggle key provides quick way to disable all functionality
- Jitter can be toggled independently but requires same activation (LMB + RMB)
- Always check window title to confirm macro state

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Another instance is running"**
   - Check Task Manager
   - End existing process if necessary
   - Restart application

2. **Admin Rights Required**
   - Run as administrator
   - Use build.bat for automatic elevation
   - Check app.manifest settings

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Switch to Release build
   - Check system resources
   - Adjust timer intervals
   - Monitor debug panel

## Development

### Environment Setup
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 or later
2. Install .NET 6.0 SDK
3. Clone repository
4. Open solution file
